Daily Programmer Easy Challenge #50 August 5, 2013
Summary:
Write a program that given an array A and a number N, generates all combinations of items
in A of length N.
That is, if you are given the array [1,2,3,4,5] and 3, you're supposed to generate
[1,2,3]
[1,2,4]
[1,2,5]
[1,3,4]
[1,3,5]
[1,4,5]
[2,3,4]
[2,3,5]
[2,4,5]
[3,4,5]
Note that order doesn't matter when counting combinations, both [1,2,3] and [3,2,1] are
considered the same. Order also doesn't matter in the output of the combinations, as long
as you generate all of them, you don't have to worry about what order they pop out. You can
also assume that every element of the array is distinct.

puts list.combination(length).to_a.to_s
